- Model uses 9 input features: reviewText, title, rating, genre, reviewerName, originalLanguage, distributor, director, audienceScore
- Three trained models available: LogisticRegression, SVC, SGD
- Need to recreate the preprocessing pipeline from the notebook
- Should provide predictions from all three models for comparison
